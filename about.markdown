I am a 4th-year undergraduate student. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE branch from JSS Academy of Technical Education Noida. I am a tech enthusiast and love working on the latest technology. I work on MEVN Stack(MongoDB,Express,Vue.js,Node.js) and Android App Development. I have a handful of experience on deploying apps on servers both cloud and local. I have experience on AWS and GCE. I have explored docker as well. I keep looking for opportunities to learn and develop new skills. I believe in project-based learning.
